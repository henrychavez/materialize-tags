# Materialize Tags
Materialize Tags is a jQuery plugin providing a Material Design user interface for managing tags.

## Features
* Objects as tags
* Typeaheadjs
* Designed for [Materialize v0.97.3] (http://materializecss.com/)

### Objects as tags
<b>Not just support strings!</b> This means you can use different values for a tag's label and value. Each tag also holds a reference to the object by which it was created, so by calling <code>$(element).materialtags('items')</code> an array of the original items is returned.

### Typehead support
Integrates with [Typeaheadjs] (https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) for more flexibility
